# ─── Install Configuration Input (install.env) ────────────────────────────────
# The hand-authored record of what this install is, loaded BEFORE the parameter
# block below so that every `${VAR:-}` seed in it inherits from the file. That
# ordering is the whole mechanism: inheriting prior configuration stops being
# something each flag has to remember to do and becomes the default path.
#
# An input the installer reads and does not rewrite. It creates one at the end
# of a first install, when there is nothing there, and never touches it again:
# a file the documentation tells you to edit and the next run overwrites is
# exactly the complaint against vars.sh, whose header said "auto-generated"
# while INSTALL.md told you to hand-edit it.
#
# `set -a` rather than a K=V parser: these values have to reach
# write_tfvars_from_state and the TF_VAR_* handoff at the end of it, both of
# which read the environment. A conventional dotenv without `export` would parse
# and then not travel.
#
# Always resolves to a path, whether or not a file is there yet -- a first
# install has nothing to read, and this is also where the file gets written.
#
# The directory is the CHECKOUT the run will end up in, which under
# `curl … | bash` is not the directory the operator is standing in. There
# ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} names no file, so a script-relative path resolves to the
# invocation directory; acquire_source_repo then clones to $HOME/kube-agents
# and cd's there, and every other front door resolves the file as
# ${repo_dir}/install.env (default_install_env_file). Freezing the invocation
# directory here would put the whole configuration -- API_SERVER_KEY and the
# plaintext model keys included -- where no later run looks: upgrade.sh would
# take its fail-closed branch, and a re-run of the one-liner would rebuild
# every PARAM_* from defaults.
#
# So resolve the same repo_dir acquire_source_repo will pick, by the same test
# and in the same order, before the parameter block reads any of it. This has
# to stay in step with acquire_source_repo; the shared marker file is the
# coupling, and test_install_script.py pins the pair.

🤖 kube-agents Zero-Friction Installer

Usage:
  ./install.sh [FLAGS]

Flags for AI Agents & Automation:
  -y, --yes, --non-interactive  Run in non-interactive mode (use flags/defaults)
  --generate-only               Generate install.env and terraform.tfvars, run
                                pre-apply checks, print lifecycle commands, and
                                exit without applying
  --dry-run                     Validate prerequisites & output config/plan without creating resources
  --gcp-project-id=ID           Target GCP Project ID
  --gcp-region=REGION           Target GCP Region (default: install.defaults.env
                                DEFAULT_REGION, currently us-central1)
  --gke-cluster-name=NAME       GKE Cluster Name (default: DEFAULT_CLUSTER_NAME,
                                currently platform-agent-host)
  --gke-cluster-mode=MODE       Shape of a cluster this run creates: autopilot | standard
                                (default: DEFAULT_CLUSTER_MODE, currently autopilot).
                                Autopilot clusters are regional. Passing this flag with
                                autopilot and a zonal --gcp-region is an error; leaving it
                                unset at a zonal --gcp-region builds Standard instead.
                                Ignored when installing onto a cluster that already
                                exists — its live shape wins.
  --agent-namespace=NAMESPACE   Kubernetes namespace the release installs into
                                (default: DEFAULT_NAMESPACE, currently kubeagents-system).
                                The chart wires the agent's model-gateway endpoint to this
                                namespace, so changing it is for CI and second installs

                                (default: DEFAULT_MODEL_PROVIDER, currently gemini)
  --model-default-name=NAME     Default model name for the provider
  --model-max-tokens=N          Output tokens the gateway asks the provider for on a
                                request that names none, for a self-hosted backend
                                whose prompt and output share one window
                                (default: DEFAULT_MODEL_MAX_TOKENS, currently 0:

                                (default: DEFAULT_VERTEX_LOCATION, currently global)
  --vertex-manage-serving-project=BOOL

                                            store existed, so an upgrade that says nothing
                                            keeps the store it already has. Per-user Markdown

                                            model's context every turn, so it stops scaling
                                            once there is more than a few pages of it.

                                            and a Postgres database into the cluster.

                                            provider, and no database to run.
  --image-tag=TAG               Validated immutable release tag or full commit SHA.
                                Developer and CI/CD testing only; end users should use
                                official release installations where image tags are baked in
                                (default: inferred from baked release, release bundle, or local HEAD)
  --registry-prefix=PATH        Container registry path without a URL scheme, for the images
                                this project builds (operator, agent, credential proxy, replay
                                proxy)
  --third-party-registry-prefix=PATH
                                Registry path holding the mirrored third-party images
                                (LiteLLM, fluent-bit, the GitHub token minter, Hindsight).
                                Unset, they stay on their upstream registries --
                                --registry-prefix deliberately does not cover them.
                                See 'make mirror-images'
  --allow-unverified-source     Provision from a dirty or mismatched checkout (local script edits
                                are applied even though the deployed image was built elsewhere)
  --enable-google-chat[=true|false]
                                Enable Google Chat integration
  --enable-slack[=true|false]   Enable the Slack socket-mode relay. Non-interactively
                                this requires --slack-bot-token and --slack-app-token
  --enable-pubsub-platform[=true|false]

                                agent over Google Chat. Empty allows all users
  --chat-topic-name=TOPIC       Pub/Sub topic name for Google Chat
                                (default: DEFAULT_CHAT_TOPIC_NAME,

  --chat-sub-name=SUB           Pub/Sub subscription name for Google Chat
                                (default: derived as <topic>-sub when --chat-topic-name
                                is custom; DEFAULT_CHAT_SUB_NAME on default topic)
  --google-chat-mode=MODE       Google Chat output mode: default | debug
                                (default: DEFAULT_GOOGLE_CHAT_MODE, currently default)
  --google-chat-home-channel=SPACE_ID
                                Google Chat space ID for unsolicited alerts/messages (e.g. spaces/AAAA...)
  --slack-bot-token=TOKENS      Comma-separated Slack bot tokens (xoxb-...), one per
                                workspace the agent serves. The relay keys each one by
                                the team it authenticates as
  --slack-app-token=TOKEN       Slack socket-mode app-level token (xapp-...)
  --slack-allowed-users=USERS   Comma-separated Slack user IDs allowed to talk to the
                                agent. Empty allows all users
  --slack-home-channel=CHANNEL  Slack channel ID for unsolicited alerts/messages (e.g. C01234567)
  --slack-home-channel-name=NAME
                                Display name of that channel (e.g. #gke-alerts)
  --migrate-node-pools          Authorize migrating an existing cluster's legacy node pools to
                                GKE_METADATA. Recreates those nodes and restarts every workload on
                                them, kube-agents' or not. Without it a cluster with legacy pools is
                                refused unchanged (REFUSED_MISSING_NODE_POOL_MIGRATION); there is no
                                install without Workload Identity. The cluster's owner decides this.
  --enable-network-policy       Authorize enabling the legacy Calico NetworkPolicy addon and
                                enforcement on an existing GKE Standard cluster that has neither it
                                nor Dataplane V2. May recreate nodes and restart workloads. One of
                                two answers for such a cluster; the other is below, and without
                                either the cluster is refused unchanged (REFUSED_MISSING_NETWORK_POLICY).
                                The cluster's owner decides this.
  --accept-no-network-policy    Install onto such a cluster without modifying it. Every NetworkPolicy
                                kube-agents ships is then inert, including the ones that confine the
                                agent's shell sandbox; the choice is recorded in the install report
                                and on the PlatformAgent. Mutually exclusive with the flag above.

Configuration file:
  install.env beside this script (override with KUBE_AGENTS_INSTALL_ENV) is
  loaded first, and a flag beats it. It is sourced with 'set -a', so a key it
  carries also beats an exported variable of the same name -- a flag is what
  overrides a recorded value for one run. Start from install.env.example.
  Anything it sets is inherited by later runs, so a re-run that omits a flag
  keeps the value rather than reverting it to the default above.

# the next run overwrites.
#
# Called after write_tfvars_from_state so the API_SERVER_KEY it records is the
# one the install settled on: recovered from a live Secret when there was one,
# freshly minted only when there was not.
#
# Derived values are left out by construction. PROJECT_NUMBER and KMS_LOCATION
# are recomputed wherever they are used, and the cluster shape written here is
# the one the interview asked for, never the probed TFVARS_CLUSTER_MODE, which
# write_tfvars_from_state re-derives on every run.
# The value install.env records for one key, empty when it records none.
# Reads the file rather than the environment: install.env was sourced at
# startup into these very names, and the interview has since overwritten them,
# so the environment no longer remembers what the file said.
#
# Always returns 0. A `return 1` for "no such key" would be the natural
# signature and is the wrong one here: this is called from a command
# substitution, `set -E` propagates the ERR trap into that subshell, and the
# trap fires on the non-zero return before the caller's `||` is ever consulted
# -- printing an abort banner per absent key. Callers test presence separately.
#
# The value is unquoted the way sourcing the file would unquote it, because
# both things that write install.env quote it. write_env_var here and
# save_env_var in scripts/installer/installer_common.sh both serialise with
# `printf '%s=%q\n'`, and %q renders the empty string as the two-character
# literal '' and escapes anything the shell would treat specially -- so
# `#gke-alerts` is written `\#gke-alerts`. Comparing a quoted recorded value
# against an unquoted environment one reports every empty key as drifted, and
# the line the banner prints for each (`KEY=`) changes nothing, so the next run
# reports them again. That buries the
# one case the warning exists for.
#
# A hand-authored file is the other half of the same problem and the reason
# this cannot simply re-quote the current value and compare the quoted forms:
# an operator writes `SLACK_HOME_CHANNEL="#gke-alerts"`, which %q would render

  #   2. The answer must be readable under the key's own name. Most of the
  #      interview re-exports into exactly that name, but MEMORY does not: its
  #      answer lands in PARAM_MEMORY and in MEMORY_PROVIDER, and MEMORY itself
  #      still holds whatever install.env set at startup. Comparing `$MEMORY`

# A flag that beats install.env for a single run, against a file this installer
# will not rewrite. Says so, because the reversal is silent at both ends: the
# run that passes the flag looks like it took effect permanently, and the next
# run that omits it re-reads the file and quietly undoes the change.
#
# Only reachable on an existing install.env. A first install records both keys
# from the same PARAM_*, so there is nothing to warn about there.
#
# Fires on -y as well, unlike warn_unrecorded_interview_answers: that one skips
# non-interactive runs because their answers came from flags and the file, with
# no third source to surprise anyone. Here the flag IS the surprise, and headless
# is the route these flags were added for.
#
# Pass compare_as_bool=true for a key the rest of the pipeline reads through
# is_truthy, and both sides are then read the same way. Neither is canonical:
# install.env is hand-written and render_install_env.sh copies a GitHub variable
# in verbatim, so the recorded value can be True/yes/on/1 -- and the same PARAM_*
# is seeded from that value, so on a run that passes no flag the "flag value" is
# that spelling too. Comparing the two as strings reports a disagreement that
# does not exist, and the operator gets the destructive consequence line for a
# reversal that cannot happen: the next run re-reads True, is_truthy accepts it,
# and nothing changes. NAMESPACE is a string and keeps the literal comparison --
# `true` is a legal namespace name, and reading a recorded `yes` against a
# flagged `true` as agreement would drop a warning about a release moving.
#
# repeat_on names the routes that accept the flag: --agent-namespace is taken
# by install.sh, upgrade.sh and --menu; --enable-gke-backup-plan is install.sh-only.
