// The A2A stack the operator renders under `mode: next` and nothing else:
// the NATS/JetStream component, its stream/KV/topic provisioning, and the A2A
// gateway Deployment. Dark by construction — no call site outside the
// renderMode gate in Reconcile reaches this file.
//
// The deployment spec (docs/designs/spec-nats-deployment.md) is the law for
// streams, retention, and the account layout; subjects come from the payload
// spec (docs/designs/spec-a2a-payloads.md).
//
// PLAYGROUND POSTURE (stage 1): single-node R1 JetStream (production: 3-node
// R3), no audit exporter, no breaker, gateway sweep as the only janitor. Each
// has a decided design in the specs; none gates letting people play.
//
// Authentication came off that list. The auth callout is armed, and the
// identities that have a ServiceAccount and a client that presents it — the
// session pods above all — authenticate through it. The static users that
// remain are enumerated in a2aPostureComment below, which travels onto the

	// it is. The cap and the stream now come off the same number.

	// before this derived it, and 64 is also what stops the `web` user - which
	// holds $JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.TASKS.> and no DELETE, because durability is

// a2aBridgeJetStreamGrants is the bridge's publish allow-list for the

// A5 split the enumeration between the two workloads that were sharing it (the
// topic-stream half is a2aAgentJetStreamGrants below).
//
// The wildcard covered STREAM.PURGE, STREAM.UPDATE, STREAM.DELETE and
// STREAM.MSG.DELETE on every stream, DIRECTORY included. One PURGE empties the
// directory for every profile and nothing repopulates it; DELETE leaves only a
// re-run of the provision Job to bring the stream back.
//
// The list is what the bridge emits, read out of nats.go and then measured
// against a real server running this render
// (TestBridgeJetStreamGrantOnARealServer). Per stream:
//
//   - TASKS: STREAM.INFO (js.Stream in lib.TasksGet and the sweep),
//     CONSUMER.CREATE (the durable through CreateOrUpdateConsumer, and
//     the replay's ordered consumer; nats.go puts the filter subject in the API
//     subject, so the grant ends in `>`), CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT (every pull), and
//     DIRECT.GET (GetLastMsgForSubject: the replay horizon and the sweep's CAS
//     baseline). Acks are $JS.ACK.TASKS.>, granted beside this list.
//   - KV_runtime-state, the in-flight registry: STREAM.INFO
//     (js.KeyValue binds a bucket by reading its stream), and CONSUMER.CREATE
//     with CONSUMER.DELETE (kv.Keys is a push ordered consumer that nats.go
//     creates and then deletes on Unsubscribe, and the sweep runs it at every
//     bridge start). Put and Delete are publishes on $KV.runtime-state.>,
//     granted beside this list. No DIRECT.GET: nothing on the path calls
//     kv.Get -- the bridge puts, deletes and lists, and the worker adapter
//     touches no bucket at all -- and when a caller appears the grant is
//     DIRECT.GET.KV_runtime-state.>, with the server test as the place its
//     absence shows.
//
// Reads go through DIRECT.GET and not STREAM.MSG.GET because every stream the
// provision script creates has allow_direct set: the script says
// --allow-direct on each `stream add` (natscli's default too, stated so the
// grant does not rest on one), a KV bucket always has it, and the live store
// shows it on all seven. nats.go picks the route from the stream's own config,
// so the fallback is never emitted and is not granted.
//
// What the wildcard granted that nothing on the bridge path uses, and this
// list now refuses: every verb on DIRECTORY (no STREAM.INFO, no consumer, no
// DIRECT.GET -- the gateway keeps subscribe on the cards, which is the read
// discovery needs), every verb on KV_session-state and KV_cap, PURGE / UPDATE /
// DELETE / MSG.DELETE / RESTORE / SNAPSHOT on every stream, STREAM.CREATE,
// enumeration (STREAM.NAMES, STREAM.LIST, CONSUMER.NAMES, CONSUMER.LIST),
// account INFO (jetstream.New never asks for it), and CONSUMER.INFO (nothing
// on the path binds to an existing consumer by name, and on nats.go v1.53.1
// no consumer re-verifies itself with it after a reconnect either --
// TestBridgeConsumersSurviveABusRestart holds that across a server restart).
//
// CONSUMER.DELETE on TASKS is withheld, and it is the one subject nats.go
// does emit here without a grant. The only emitter is the ordered consumer's
// reset path, which fires DeleteConsumer for the consumer it is replacing in
// a goroutine and ignores the result; the ephemeral it could not delete is
// reaped by the inactive threshold lib.TasksGet sets on it,
// lib.EphemeralConsumerInactiveThreshold (five seconds -- nats.go's own
// ordered default is five MINUTES, which is what the replay carried before
// gke-labs/kube-agents#1739). TasksGet does not delete its own replay
// consumer, and that is a decision rather than an omission: under this grant
// the delete is a refused publish on a subject with no reply, so the bridge
// would pay an Error-level permissions violation on every task it dispatches
// -- the line an operator is taught to read as a missing grant -- to reclaim
// the last five seconds of one consumer slot.
//
// Withholding it raises the price of reaching another principal's durable and
// does not close the route, which is the correction to what this comment said
// first. CONSUMER.CREATE is create-OR-UPDATE by name -- the request's `action`
// field is empty for both, and the server has no ownership concept for a
// consumer name -- so within a stream the bridge may create consumers on,
// every consumer on that stream is the bridge's to reconfigure. Measured
// against this render, on the gateway's relay durable: one permitted
// $JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.TASKS.gateway-relay carrying the durable's own
// config with filter_subject changed retunes it, and the gateway stops seeing
// task events with no permissions violation logged anywhere; the same subject
// carrying inactive_threshold has the server reap the durable, ack floor and
// all, while CONSUMER.DELETE is refused in the same run. That is the residue
// the web block below already records for web, on the one stream where
// another principal has a durable to aim at. It is not new -- $JS.API.>
// permitted all of it -- and no narrower grant exists: nats.go's ordered
// consumers take server-generated names, so the last token has to be `>`, and
// NATS wildcards match whole tokens, so a per-prefix grant matches a consumer
// literally named that. What closes it is the auth callout giving each
// principal its own user. DELETE stays out as the one destructive verb here
// that nothing on the bridge path needs: its one emitter ignores the result
// and the threshold gets there anyway, so the grant's absence costs a log
// line on a reset and up to five seconds of a consumer slot, not a behaviour.
//
// One route this list narrows but cannot close, because it lives in a request
// body: a push consumer's deliver_subject. CONSUMER.CREATE on TASKS (or on the
// KV bucket) lets the bridge ask the server to deliver that stream's messages
// onto any subject, and a stream whose subjects cover the deliver subject
// stores them -- under their ORIGINAL subjects, so this is not forgery (a
// topic or card read by subject never sees them) but it is a persisted write
// into a stream the bridge has no publish grant for, and with discard=old an
// eviction lever against it. The server delivers only once a subscription
// exists whose subject is EXACTLY the deliver subject: a push consumer
// registers through Sublist.registerNotification, which takes interest only
// from a match whose `sub.subject` is byte-equal to the deliver subject, and
// says so in its own doc comment ("this interest needs to be exact and ...
// wildcards will not trigger the notifications"). Identical in 2.10.29 and
// 2.14.5, and it is what bounds the residue: a principal watching the whole
// plane is not enough, and neither is a stream's own wildcard ingest.
// Measured on both versions, that splits the streams in two. TOPICS-STATE and
// TOPICS-JOURNAL have literal subjects, so their own ingest subscription IS
// the exact match and the write lands with no help (three TASKS messages
// arrived in TOPICS-STATE under a2a.tasks.* subjects). DIRECTORY, TASKS and
// the buckets have wildcard subjects, so a client has to hold a subscription
// on the deliver subject itself -- for the directory, another principal
// subscribed to one card subject. The gateway's `a2a.agents.>` and web's
// `a2a.>` subscribe grants permit that but do not supply it: a subscription
// on either wildcard leaves DIRECTORY empty, measured. Nothing in the tree
// opens a literal card subscription today. The wildcard this replaces had the
// same route with every stream as a source; what closes it is the bridge not
// holding CONSUMER.CREATE at all, which is a pre-created consumer per task
// (the stage-3 dispatcher), not a grant. The server test measures all four
// cases.

// off the wildcard in #1306 and worker in #1393, and with this one no
// rendered principal holds it.
//
// The gateway is the task requester, the chat-session supervisor and the
// session registry's owner. The wildcard covered STREAM.DELETE on every
// stream in the account, which #1666 measured live: one call as this user
// destroyed TASKS, taking every task's event history and its five live
// consumers with it, and the provision Job then recreated the stream empty on
// the next reconcile -- so the loss reads as healthy from the operator's side.
// It also made the ack scoping beside it moot. That grant is scoped to TASKS
// precisely so this user cannot +TERM another principal's in-flight delivery,
// and `$JS.API.CONSUMER.DELETE.TASKS.*` sat inside the wildcard the whole
// time.
//
// The list is what the gateway's own binaries emit, read out of nats.go
// v1.53.1 and then measured against a real server running this render
// (TestGatewayJetStreamGrantOnARealServer). Per stream:
//
//   - TASKS: STREAM.INFO (js.Stream, in lib.TasksGet), CONSUMER.CREATE (the
//     `gateway-relay` durable through CreateOrUpdateConsumer, and the
//     replay's ordered consumer), CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT (every pull on both),
//     and DIRECT.GET (GetLastMsgForSubject: tasks/get's replay horizon).
//     Acks are $JS.ACK.TASKS.>, granted beside this list.
//
//     CONSUMER.CREATE ends in `>` rather than naming the durable, and both
//     reasons are load-bearing. The relay carries TWO filter subjects
//     (`…events` and `…supervisor`, since the supervisor split), and nats.go
//     puts the filter in the API subject only when there is exactly one
//     (jetstream/consumer.go, apiConsumerCreateWithFilterSubjectT), so the
//     relay's own create is `CONSUMER.CREATE.TASKS.gateway-relay` while a
//     single-filter rebind would be four tokens longer. And the replay's
//     ordered consumers take server-generated names
//     (jetstream.go, OrderedConsumer, which seeds namePrefix from nuid.Next),
//     so no literal exists to name.
//
//   - KV_session-state, the session registry: STREAM.INFO (js.KeyValue binds
//     a bucket by reading its stream), DIRECT.GET (kv.Get, which every
//     registry read goes through -- Get, SessionForTask, and the reap scan's
//     per-key read), and CONSUMER.CREATE with CONSUMER.DELETE
//     (kv.ListKeysFiltered is a push ordered consumer that nats.go creates
//     and then deletes on Unsubscribe, and the reap loop runs it on a timer).
//     Create, Put and Delete are publishes on $KV.session-state.>, granted
//     beside this list.
//
// Reads go through DIRECT.GET and not STREAM.MSG.GET because every stream the
// provision script creates has allow_direct set: the script says
// --allow-direct on each `stream add`, and a KV bucket always has it. nats.go
// picks the route from the stream's own config (jetstream/stream.go, getMsg),
// so the fallback is never emitted and is not granted.
//
// What the wildcard granted that nothing on the gateway path uses, and this
// list now refuses: STREAM.DELETE, PURGE, UPDATE, MSG.DELETE, RESTORE and
// SNAPSHOT on every stream, #1666's TASKS deletion included; every verb on
// DIRECTORY (the gateway keeps SUBSCRIBE on the cards, which is the read
// discovery needs), on KV_runtime-state and on KV_cap; every verb on the two
// topic streams, which nothing in a2a/gateway touches; STREAM.CREATE;
// enumeration (STREAM.NAMES, STREAM.LIST, CONSUMER.NAMES, CONSUMER.LIST); and
// account INFO, which jetstream.New never asks for.
//
// CONSUMER.INFO is withheld, and it is worth stating because it costs
// something. Nothing on the gateway path binds a consumer by name -- the
// relay is CreateOrUpdateConsumer, the replay is an ordered consumer -- and on
// nats.go v1.53.1 neither re-verifies itself with Info() after a reconnect
// either: the Consume status loop re-issues a pull on CONNECTED, and the
// ordered consumer's reset is a CONSUMER.CREATE. TestGatewayConsumersSurviveABusRestart
// holds that across a server restart rather than resting on the reading. What
// it costs is that the gateway can no longer read back the state of a
// consumer it owns, which is a diagnostic it never used and the `web` user
// still holds.
//
// CONSUMER.DELETE on TASKS is withheld too, and it is the one subject nats.go
// emits here without a grant. The only emitter is the ordered consumer's
// reset path, which fires DeleteConsumer in a goroutine and ignores the
// result (jetstream/ordered.go, reset). What it buys is removing this user's
// route to another principal's durable by name -- a session pod's three
// consumers included -- and it is not free. Two costs, both on the reset path
// and neither on the steady state:
//
//   - The refused request reaches nats.go's async error handler, which in
//     a2a/lib's client logs at Error level (a2a/lib/client.go, the
//     ErrorHandler option). So a bus bounce or a heartbeat gap while N
//     tasks/get replays are in flight writes N "permissions violation for
//     publish to $JS.API.CONSUMER.DELETE.TASKS.<name>" lines into the
//     gateway's own log, for a refusal that is by design. Measured in
//     TestGatewayConsumersSurviveABusRestart, which asserts that this is the
//     only violation the restart produces.
//   - The pre-reset ephemeral is not removed immediately; it waits out its
//     own five-minute inactive threshold -- nats.go's ordered-consumer
//     default (jetstream/ordered.go), which lib.TasksGet does not override --
//     holding a TASKS consumer slot against max_consumers. Stopping an
//     ordered iterator never deleted its consumer under the wildcard either,
//     so the per-replay ephemeral is pre-existing -- what this adds is that
//     the RESET path's old consumer lingers too. Measured on the rendered
//     config: a reconnect that leaves the server running holds two slots per
//     replay in flight, the old consumer and its replacement, until the
//     threshold expires; a bus bounce leaves only the replacement, because
//     these consumers are memory storage with one replica and the restarting
//     server drops them. Those slots are the gateway's and never a session's,
//     so whatever sizes TASKS' max_consumers has to count concurrent
//     tasks/get replays beside the session cap. A budget that counts sessions
//     alone runs out under replay load and refuses a legitimate session's
//     consumer create, which reads as an undersized stream.
//
// Neither is worth the grant, but the cost is stated rather than described as
// free, which is what this comment said first.
//
// Two routes this list narrows but cannot close, both recorded here because
// they survive any per-stream scoping of a principal that may create
// consumers at all. CONSUMER.CREATE is create-OR-UPDATE by name and the
// server has no ownership concept for a consumer name, so within TASKS every
// consumer is this user's to reconfigure or to have reaped through an
// inactive_threshold it sets -- measured for `bridge` in
// a2aBridgeJetStreamGrants, identical here. And a push consumer's
// deliver_subject is a body field no subject grant can see. Neither is new;
// $JS.API.> permitted both, with every stream as a source rather than one.
// What closes them is per-task consumers created by the dispatcher, not a
// grant. The gateway is also the principal these residues matter least for:
// it is the requester and the supervisor, so it already writes the task plane

// withheld. Seed's JetStream API grant is scoped to the streams it provisions,
// the bridge's and the agent's to the streams each one uses, and the gateway's

// (a2aSeedJetStreamGrants, a2aBridgeJetStreamGrants, a2aAgentJetStreamGrants,
// a2aGatewayJetStreamGrants), and provision has moved
// to the callout and holds the enumerated subjects too (its identity entry
// spells them). No rendered principal holds a bare $JS.API.> any more: the
// gateway was the last, and the narrowing #1666 asked for took it. What
// per-stream enumeration still
// cannot express is inside a granted stream -- a consumer's name, its

// pw is a parameter rather than a closure over the creds Secret because two
// callers walk this template: buildA2ANATSConfigSecret with the real lookup,
// and a2aConfigRolloutHash with one that returns placeholders. One template
// and two lookups is what lets the rollout digest cover every non-secret byte
// without covering a credential — a password interpolated here by any route
// other than pw is back in the digest.
//
// TestA2AConfigRolloutHashOmitsCredentialsAndTracksRotation is the guard for
// that: it hashes two creds Secrets that differ only in their password bytes
// and requires the digests to be equal, so any route by which a credential
// re-enters the hashed input reds it.
// TestA2ARenderedObjectsCarryNoPasswordDigest is the wider but shallower one —
// it catches a digest of a password, or of the real conf, reaching a rendered
// name, label or annotation, and it cannot see a credential folded into the
// hashed bytes as a third string.
//
// keys carries the callout's two PUBLIC keys, which is why they travel with
// pw's placeholders rather than being one of them: an issuer public key is not
// a credential, and the rollout digest has to cover it. If it did not, rotating
// the callout keypair would update the config Secret without rolling the
// StatefulSet, leaving the server trusting an issuer nothing signs with any
// more — every answer the callout gives refused, on a bus that looks healthy.

# surface is reachable through kubectl and through nothing else. Production
# still terminates TLS in front of the bus, which is not a toggle that exists

// harmless against 32 random hex characters, an offline target the day a
// password is hand-set, and CodeQL alert 27 (go/weak-sensitive-data-hashing).

//
// The hash is no longer content-addressed. resourceVersion moves on ANY

// rolls the single-replica bus once with nothing the server reads having
// changed — clients reconnect, and JetStream state lives on the PV. An unkeyed
// digest of the password bytes would ignore metadata churn but is the alert
// this function exists to close, so the spurious roll is the price of not
// hashing the credential. secretEnvHash (platformagent_secret_hash.go) has
// since shown a third way — an HMAC over the values keyed by the Secret's UID,
// which ignores metadata churn without an unkeyed digest — and moving this
// function onto it is a separate change: it alters when the bus rolls under
// mode: next and needs its own live test.
//
// And the rotation it notices rolls the bus, not the bus's clients. This hash
// rides the NATS pod template alone; the gateway Deployment and the provision
// Job take their passwords through valueFrom.secretKeyRef, which a running pod
// does not re-read, so a repaired credential leaves the gateway holding the old

//	            survive a restart and a policy pinned to one stops matching
//	            silently.
//	LiteLLM   — the model path. Ports 80/4000/8080 for the reason
//	            buildAgentEgressNetworkPolicy's LiteLLM rule states: a Pod
//	            selector matches after the ClusterIP translation, so the port

// this pod. What it does not carry is a route to the API server, and this
// policy is what withholds it. The kubelet delivers the token through the

// AutomountServiceAccountToken stays false in spawn.go so no second,
// default-audience token rides along; and the session ServiceAccount holds no
// RBAC and no Workload Identity annotation, so the token would buy nothing
// even if a route existed. Three independent reasons, which is deliberate:
// this is the pod that executes model output.
//
// A worker that needs the internet is a design change, not a policy widening.

#
# The token goes in the PASSWORD field rather than a --token flag. NOT for
# secrecy: --password puts it on argv exactly as --token would, so it is in
# /proc/<pid>/cmdline for the life of each call either way, and the pod is the
# boundary that matters. The reason is that the username half then carries the
# ServiceAccount this Job claims to be - a claim the callout does not trust and
# does not need to, since it validates the token and derives the identity from
# the TokenReview. It travels because it costs nothing and makes a connection
# legible in a server-side log. The callout accepts the token in either field.

# max_consumers caps each stream. Consumer durability is a request-body
# field, so no permission list can hold web to ephemeral ones (see the web user
# in nats.conf); the cap is what stops an unreapable durable per page-load from
# growing the file store without bound. The failure it converts to is loud — a
# refused create — rather than silent disk growth. Note the trade: a client that
# burns the cap can also deny a legitimate consumer, which is the right way
# round for a playground and the wrong one for production, where the callout
# mints per-identity users and this becomes a per-user limit instead.
#
# Three streams keep the flat 64. TASKS does not: it is the one stream session
# pods create consumers on, three apiece, so its cap is derived from this CR's
# maxSessions (a2aTasksMaxConsumers) and a stream that cannot hold the
# configured concurrency is a refusal below rather than a task failure at load.

# Retention rule (deployment spec): acknowledgement must not delete — all
# message streams are limits-based with an age window; replay is a read.
# Every stream carries a hard max_bytes with discard old so a flood degrades
# replay oldest-first instead of filling the PV and stalling JetStream.
#
# --allow-direct is stated on every stream even though it is the CLI's
# default: the bus grants are written for the direct-get
# route (nats.go picks DIRECT.GET or STREAM.MSG.GET from the stream's own
# config), so the bit the grant rests on is set here, not inherited.

# TASKS: a2a.tasks.>, 72h dev window, 20GiB cap.
#
# max_msgs_per_subject bounds ONE SUBJECT, which on this stream is one class of
# one task: a2a.tasks.{addressee}.{taskId}.{in,events,supervisor}. Read what it
# does and does not buy, because the two are easy to swap.
#
# It buys: a runaway executor - a loop, a harness streaming forever - can no
# longer push 20GiB through the stream on one task and, with discard=old, evict
# every other session's history on the way. The runaway now pays for its own
# runaway and nobody else's.
#
# It does NOT buy containment of a session that means it. A session's publish
# grant is a2a.tasks.<pod>.*.events (authcallout/session.go, sessionGrants: the
# task id is not in the attested claim, so the grant cannot name one), so a
# session can mint unbounded distinct subjects by inventing task ids. A
# per-subject cap is not a per-publisher budget, and JetStream has no per-
# publisher budget to reach for. Closing that means putting the task id in the
# claim, which is a change to the callout's narrowing and not to a stream flag.
#
# 4096, sized against the publisher that means it rather than the well-behaved
# one: the render sets no max_payload, so NATS' 1MiB default is the per-message
# ceiling and 4096 messages is a ~4GiB worst case on one subject, a fifth of the
# stream. The worker adapter's own result chunks are resultChunkSize (256 KiB),
# so a task built out of those reaches nearer 1GiB at the same count - but that
# is a property of one publisher and not a bound the bus enforces. A chat-driven
# task emits single digits to low hundreds of events; reaching 4096 is already a
# loop or a gigabyte of streamed artifact text.
#
# What happens at the limit, because discard=old evicts the OLDEST message on
# the subject first: the oldest event on a task's ...events subject is its
# 'submitted' status-update, which assertion 9 requires and which FoldTask
# folds into StatusHistory[0]. A truncated task therefore replays without its
# head. That is only acceptable because the fold now SAYS so - lib.Task's
# SubmittedMissing is the assertion-9 observation, the sibling of
# PostFinalDropped for assertion 10 - so the eviction is a degradation a reader
# can see rather than a short history it cannot distinguish from a real one.
#
# The same eviction on the ...in class is quieter and worse, and this flag
# does not ship without the check that answers it. That subject's oldest
# message is the task's originating kind:message, which the worker re-reads on
# every start. Steers are kind:message too and nothing on the envelope marks
# the submission, so a scan past the cap returns the oldest surviving steer and
# the worker executes that as the request - with no SubmittedMissing to show
# for it, because nothing folds ...in. No stream flag closes that: per-subject
# discard:new would refuse the steer instead of the submission, which breaks
# steering, and there is no 'keep the head' policy. It is closed on the client
# side instead. The gateway publishes the submission before it spawns the pod,
# so the ack names the sequence; it passes that to the pod as A2A_ORIGIN_SEQ
# and the adapter opens its origin consumer there and refuses to run if the
# message it gets back is a different sequence. See a2a/worker-adapter
# fetchOriginAtSeq and docs/designs/spec-nats-deployment.md.

# TASKS older than this render: the limits the create above could not apply.
#
# Provisioning is create-only convergence - the info-then-add guards never
# edit an existing stream, which buildA2AProvisionJob says in terms - so an
# install whose TASKS predates a limit keeps the stream it was created with
# and gains nothing from a re-run. Both limits this render puts on TASKS are
# in exactly that position on every install that already has the stream, and
# the two gaps are not the same kind:
#
#   max_consumers short is a capacity shortfall with a load-time failure
#   attached. A legitimate session's consumer create is refused, surfaced as
#   a task failure, with nothing in it pointing at the stream. Worth
#   refusing over here, where the number that caused it is in hand.
#
#   max_msgs_per_subject absent is a missing bound, not a broken one: the
#   install behaves exactly as it did before this render carried the flag.
#   Applying it would be a TIGHTENING, and a tightening evicts: a
#   stream edit that lowers max_msgs_per_subject drops every message over
#   the new limit on every subject the moment it lands. Truncating a running
#   install's task history as an automatic side effect of an operator
#   upgrade is not a decision this script takes on an operator's behalf. It
#   reports, names the edit and what the edit costs, and moves on.
#
# This runs LAST, after every other stream and bucket, so the refusal below
# leaves a fully provisioned bus short one limit rather than a bus missing
# DIRECTORY, the topic streams and the KV buckets. The refusal is reached on
# an operator upgrade alone, with no CR edit involved - an install already
# running maxSessions above what its stream holds has been under-provisioned
# the whole time, and this is the first thing that says so.
#
# Parsed with grep rather than jq: nats-box is the image, and grep is in
# busybox for certain. An unparseable answer FAILS - a check that silently
# skips when its extractor stops matching is not a check.

// buildA2AProvisionJob runs the provisioning script against the rendered NATS.
// The name carries a digest of the rendered spec (a2aProvisionJobName) so a

// themselves up via TTL. The TTL has a known cost, chosen not overlooked: once
// it removes the Job, the next reconcile's create-if-absent re-runs the
// (idempotent) script under the same name, so a standing next install
// re-proves its provisioning roughly daily. Re-proving is not all it does.
// The TTL removes a FAILED Job on the same clock, and the closing block's
// max_consumers refusal is deterministic and now fails the Job from its
// first pod (the podFailurePolicy below), so the daily re-create is the only
// thing that ever re-checks that refusal — against a stream an operator has
// since recreated, or a maxSessions that has come down to fit the stream that
// is there. That churn is one short-lived pod a day; the alternative —
// a Job kept forever as the done-marker — trades it for permanent clutter, a
// stale-looking object in every kubectl listing, and a refusal that never
// looks again.
//
// The digest covers everything this function renders into the spec: the
// script, the image, the uid and security contexts, env, volumes, mounts,
// backoffLimit, the restart and pod failure policies, and the TTL. What becomes of the generation the render has
// moved past depends on how far that generation got, and one case is why the
// rename on its own is not enough. A completed one leaves by TTL; one whose
// pod ran and failed runs out its backoffLimit and then leaves by TTL; one
// whose pod never ran — an unpullable image, an unschedulable pod, an
// admission refusal — has no terminal condition for the TTL to start from
// and would sit in Pending until the mode flips or the agent is deleted,
// holding one slot in the namespace pod quota the whole time. That last case
// is the image override scenario this digest exists for, and it is why
// reconcileA2A sweeps superseded generations by label, keeping only the
// current render's name (deleteA2AProvisionJobs), after ensuring the Job this
// function builds rather than before it — so a reconcile leaves N+1 of them
// for a moment, never zero. Two things hold alongside that sweep: the status
// scan in reconcileA2A reads the current name only, so a Failed condition on
// a generation the sweep is about to remove never reaches the phase, and
// cleanupA2A calls the same function keeping nothing, so a mode flip removes
// every generation at once.
//
// What the digest does not cover is what is on the bus. Creation is
// create-only convergence: the script's `info || add` lines make re-runs
// clean but do NOT edit a stream that already exists, so a retention or
// subject change in a later payload reaches fresh installs only. Migrating an
// existing install is a manual `nats stream edit` — stage 1 accepts that and
// says it here rather than implying the digest-rename re-provisions.

				// BackoffLimitExceeded. Naming the consumer remedy on

				// deleting a stream deletes its consumers, and neither
				// the gateway's relay nor the Hermes bridge sidecar
				// re-creates one. Both subscribe through
				// lib.Client.SubscribeDurable, whose Consume call
				// passes no jetstream.ConsumeErrHandler, so nats.go
				// treats the deleted consumer as terminal, stops the
				// subscription and returns nothing to log — the same
				// failure the worker adapter grew a supervisor for.
				// An operator who recreates the stream and stops there
				// has a gateway still accepting delegations and
				// spawning session pods while relaying no events, a
				// bridge dispatching nothing, and a CR reading Ready.
				// The order is in the message because restarting
				// before the stream is back just fails the subscribe.
				//
				// Of the three numbers that remedy wants, only two are
				// in this process. The need is the budget, which is
				// what the script's gate compares a live stream
				// against; the recreate width is what a fresh render
				// creates, which floors at the cap TASKS shipped with,
				// so a default install needs 46 and recreates at 64.
				// The third — what the live stream actually holds — is
