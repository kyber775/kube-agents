# Add the shell sandbox's SSH keypair to an install that predates it.

# reason: the sandbox copies authorized_keys into place once at startup, so
# replacing a keypair that is already in use locks the agent out of its own
# shell until that pod restarts. An existing pair is therefore never rewritten,
# and a half-written pair (one key present, the other missing) is treated as
# absent rather than patched around — a private key whose public half was lost
# authenticates nothing.
#
# Only platform-agent-secrets is written here. The sandbox mounts a Secret of
# its own, <name>-shell-authorized-keys, and the chart renders that one from
# whatever public half it finds in platform-agent-secrets — so the step 4 helm
# upgrade below picks the pair up on its own. Writing it here too would create
# the object without Helm's ownership metadata, and that same helm upgrade would
# then refuse to adopt it. The sandbox must not mount platform-agent-secrets
# itself; see docs/designs/agent-shell-sandboxing.md#key-management.
#
# Set when this run wrote the pair, so the caller can roll the agent: the
# private half reaches the gateway pod through a Secret volume that an init
# container copies into place once at startup, so a pod that started before the
