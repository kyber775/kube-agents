"""Third-party downloads retry, and the envtest fetch is cached (#1603).

    python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'

Stdlib unittest, no pytest, matching the other suites in this directory.

A CDN blip fails a pull request whose diff contains none of the code the job
builds: two jobs on #1562 went red four minutes apart on a 504 from GitHub's
release-asset CDN. Nothing about that failure is visible in a normal run, and
nothing about the fix is either -- dropping `--retry` from a curl line, or the
`sleep` from the retry loop, fails no build and reports green until the next bad
minute, by which time the connection to this change is lost.

So the loop is *run*, not read: `RetryLoopBehaviourTest` points the recipe at a
stub `setup-envtest` and counts invocations, which is what catches a backoff
deleted from the macro. Asserting the recipe text cannot -- a mutant with no
`sleep` still contains every other token. `scripts/test_ci_connectivity_retry.py`
is the same pattern.

The Dockerfile and shell guard is a pure function over text with its own
fixtures (`DownloadCheckerTest`), for the same reason: a walk that silently
matches nothing passes just as well as one that finds everything.

#: fetch to a file before it can retry at all, which is a change of its own.

#: in a shell variable is taken on trust, since the walk cannot evaluate one
#: and hack/ci-env.sh names its retry count the way the Bash rule asks.
