# Shared definitions for the kube-agents installer front-ends.
# ==============================================================================
# Sourced by install.sh, uninstall.sh, and upgrade.sh — and this is where the
# terraform.tfvars generator lives, so the three front-ends describe the same
# install to the same engine (terraform/examples/full-install).

# Contract: the caller defines print_info / print_warning / print_error before
# calling anything here that reports. Functions read the install.env variable
# set from the environment (load it first); none of them prompt.

# ─── Shared Installer Defaults ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Every default an install gets for saying nothing lives in install.defaults.env
# at the repository root, beside install.env. One file, one job: this one has
# none of them inline, and a point of use reads its DEFAULT_* key rather than
# repeating the value. The exception is a fallback that deliberately differs
# from the fresh-install default because it describes an install that already
# exists -- `${ENABLE_GVISOR:-false}` here and in install.sh's control panel,
# each with the argument beside it. Precedence is
# install.defaults.env → an exported environment variable → install.env → a flag.
# install.env is sourced with `set -a`, which is what puts it above the export.
#
# Sourced WITHOUT `set -a`, unlike install.env. These stay shell variables: they
# are this project's defaults, not the install's configuration, and exporting
# them would put DEFAULT_* into the environment Terraform and the agent see.
#
# Resolved relative to this file rather than the working directory, because
# upgrade.sh and uninstall.sh source these helpers from a fresh clone whose
# path nobody knows in advance.

# installer persisted `export MEMORY_PROVIDER=…` into vars.sh, every migrated
# install still has it on disk, and install.sh's migration writes only MEMORY.
# write_tfvars_from_state prefers MEMORY_PROVIDER (install.sh's own run exports
# the interview's answer there, and must keep winning), so the stale provider
# would shadow the operator's edited MEMORY and regenerate the tfvars against
# the old store -- an apply then deleting the Hindsight API and its Postgres.

# Call after BOTH loads and before anything reads the pair. Not called by

# MEMORY_PROVIDER sourced from a legacy vars.sh -- the case it exists for --
# from one the operator exported for this run. So on these three front doors a
