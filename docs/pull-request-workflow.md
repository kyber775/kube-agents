# Pull-request workflow mechanics

**Scope:** The commands for getting a branch from "about to start" to "merged" in this repository —
finding work already in flight, measuring drift from `main`, validating locally, working the
automated review, the labels Tide merges on, re-running a check that flaked, and whose move it is
at any point in between.

**Owns:** the mechanics. Every _requirement_ — that you scan for duplicate work, run the pre-PR
review passes, live-test the change, resolve every thread — is stated in
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) and stays there. This page is what you open at the moment you carry one
out. When the two disagree, `AGENTS.md` is right and this page needs fixing.

A rule about how to run a command correctly can sit here rather than in `AGENTS.md`, because it
means nothing until you have the command in front of you — that self-assigning an issue needs
`triage` access is the example. The test is when a rule has to fire, though, not how
procedural it sounds: that a draft is not in the review queue reads like mechanics, but it has to
reach an agent before it decides to wait, so `AGENTS.md` states it and only the measurement behind
it is here. `AGENTS.md` is loaded into every session and this page is not, so anything that has to
fire before an agent thinks to open a link belongs on that side of the line, not this one.

The split is by form, not by topic: this page owns the mechanics that are commands, and
[`.agents/rules/`](../.agents/rules/) owns the ones that are prose. `AGENTS.md` had no budget left
to hold prose mechanics itself, so the pre-PR passes' went to
[`.agents/rules/pre_pr_review.md`](../.agents/rules/pre_pr_review.md) and the workflow-authoring
rules' to [`.agents/rules/github_actions.md`](../.agents/rules/github_actions.md). A mechanic with
no command in it goes there rather than here, whichever rule it serves.

Related: [`.agents/skills/review-preflight/SKILL.md`](../.agents/skills/review-preflight/SKILL.md)
owns the pre-PR review plumbing,
[`.agents/rules/`](../.agents/rules/) owns the rules an agent follows by family, and
[`.claude/commands/pr-review-batch.md`](../.claude/commands/pr-review-batch.md) owns the mechanics of
reviewing somebody else's pull request.

## Check whether someone is already doing it

`AGENTS.md`, "Before Starting a Task", requires this scan and says what to report. Branches live on
forks, so name the upstream repository on every call:

```bash
# Open PRs, with the files each one touches. File overlap is the strongest duplicate
# signal and one call gets it for every open PR.
gh pr list --repo gke-labs/kube-agents --state open --limit 100 \
  --json number,title,author,headRefName,isDraft,updatedAt,files

# Open issues, and who has already claimed them.
gh issue list --repo gke-labs/kube-agents --state open --limit 100 \
  --json number,title,assignees,labels

# Already tried? A closed pull request is a decision, not an absence.
gh search prs --repo gke-labs/kube-agents --state closed --limit 20 '<keywords>'
```

Claiming an unassigned issue, once the user has agreed:

```bash
gh issue edit <number> --repo gke-labs/kube-agents --add-assignee @me
```

`@me` is the account whose token you hold, and `AGENTS.md` is explicit that this makes it a person
you are volunteering. A contributor without `triage` access cannot self-assign; offer a comment
instead.

## Measure how far a branch has drifted from `main`

The files you are changing that `main` has also changed since you diverged — the list `AGENTS.md`
sends you here for:

```bash
# Fetch again before measuring anything. Every command below compares against the
# remote-tracking ref, and one you have not refreshed is stale in exactly the way
# this is about -- it answers "nothing has changed" for a main that has.
# The guard is for the offline case: `git diff` reports an unresolvable range on
# stderr while comm still exits 0, so a missing upstream/main prints an all-clear.
git fetch upstream main
git rev-parse --verify --quiet upstream/main >/dev/null || echo 'no upstream/main -- fetch first'

git rev-list --count HEAD..upstream/main   # how far this branch has drifted

# Files you are changing that main has also changed since you diverged. Three
# things the obvious version of this gets wrong:
#
#   - Your side has to count work that is not committed yet. Mid-branch, most of
#     what you are changing is still in the working tree, and a commit-only
#     comparison calls that case clean. `git diff HEAD` covers staged and
#     unstaged; `ls-files --others` adds files you have created but not added.
#   - --no-renames keeps both sides naming the same path. Rename detection is on
#     by default, so when main renames a file you are editing, its side reports
#     only the new path and yours only the old, and the intersection is empty.
#     Docs restructures move whole trees here, so this is not hypothetical.
#   - The two `...` ranges are in opposite orders -- your side of the fork point,
#     then main's. Do not pass the first as a pathspec to the second: a branch
#     with no commits of its own passes an empty pathspec, which git reads as no
#     filter and answers "every file main touched".
comm -12 <( { git diff --no-renames --name-only upstream/main...HEAD
              git diff --no-renames --name-only HEAD
              git ls-files --others --exclude-standard; } | sort -u ) \
         <(git diff --no-renames --name-only HEAD...upstream/main | sort)
```

`AGENTS.md` says what to do with the result. The one mechanical detail it leaves out: rebase refuses
on a dirty tree, so commit or stash before you start one.

## Local validation before committing

`AGENTS.md` names these checks; the detail is here.

**Formatting.** Run `prettier --write <files>` on changed Markdown or YAML files — `.md`, `.yaml`,
and `.yml` are the three extensions both CI and `make prettier-check` look at, so a reformatted
`.json` file is churn nothing asked for. `make prettier-check` checks all files — note that this
covers files outside your PR scope, while CI only checks the ones your branch changed. Install the version CI pins (see the Install Prettier step
in `.github/workflows/prettier.yml`), e.g. `npm install -g prettier@<that version>`: the manifests
gate in `k8s-operator-test.yml` asserts byte-equality against that version's output, so a skew fails
CI on files you did not touch. Prefer the installed binary over `npx prettier`, which re-resolves the
package against the npm registry on every run and fails outright behind an authenticated mirror —
that failure is why this step has previously been skipped rather than run.

**Shell scripts.** If you change a `.sh` file, run `make shellcheck`. The `validate` job runs the
same target on every pull request, and it is a required check, so a warning-severity finding in
any tracked script fails the merge. Install the shellcheck release that job pins (see the Install
shellcheck step in `.github/workflows/validate.yml`) from
<https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/releases> rather than the distribution package: the apt
package on the `ubuntu-latest` runner image is 0.9.0 (Ubuntu 24.04), two releases behind, and a
release two behind reports a different set of findings than CI.
Fix a finding or suppress it with `# shellcheck disable=SCnnnn # reason` on the line above the
command (shellcheck rejects a directive placed after one); the Makefile's exclude list is not the
place, and the comment above the target says why.

**Docker build.** Validate the agent runner Dockerfile by building it locally:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f deploy/docker/Dockerfile --target platform .
```

`make docker-build-platform` runs the same build and supplies `HERMES_AGENT_TAG` from `tags.env`,
the build argument the Dockerfile has no default for and the `Docker Build` CI job passes from the
same file.

Keep `--platform linux/amd64`: the base images are multi-arch and deployment targets are amd64 GKE
nodes, so a bare build on an arm64 machine produces an image that cannot run on the cluster (#560).

**Image layer budget.** If you add a `RUN` or `COPY` to `deploy/docker/Dockerfile`, build the
`platform` target with `-t platform-agent:latest` and run `python3 scripts/check_image_layers.py`.
Docker's overlay2 driver stops mounting at 128 layers and `agent-base` → `platform` is the deepest
chain the file ships; the gate fails at 120, leaving a fix somewhere to go. Because buildx has no
such limit, an over-budget image passes every PR build and fails only in Cloud Build, on main,
after merge (#658). CI runs the same check in
`docker-build.yml`. The docstring in `scripts/check_image_layers.py` owns which image the gate points
at and why — read it before changing the target.

**Third-party download retries.** A non-piped `curl` that fetches over the network in
`deploy/docker/Dockerfile`, `deploy/sandbox/Dockerfile`, `hack/ci-env.sh` or
`.github/workflows/validate.yml` needs both
`--retry N` and `--retry-all-errors` — the count alone does not survive a connection reset
mid-transfer, and without either a bad second from the upstream CDN fails a build that has
nothing to do with the download. `tests/test_third_party_download_retry.py` fails the pull
request otherwise, and its `DOWNLOAD_SOURCES` is the hand-maintained list of files it walks — a new
file that downloads something is not covered until it is added there. A download piped into a
consumer is exempt, because curl retries by restarting the transfer and the consumer has already
been fed the bytes of the failed one.

That module gates more than the flags. It also runs the envtest retry loop in `k8s-operator/Makefile`
against a stub, and reads the envtest cache steps in `k8s-operator-test.yml` and `a2a-test.yml` —
one shared key, restored everywhere and saved only on main — so editing the macro or dropping a
cache step fails it too. Run it with `python3 -m unittest tests.test_third_party_download_retry`.

**Operator code.** If you modify `k8s-operator/`, run `make` or `go build` inside that directory to
ensure compilation succeeds.

**A2A module code.** If you modify `a2a/`, run `go vet ./...` and `go test -race ./...` inside that
directory — what the `A2A Module Tests` CI job runs. The conformance suite starts an embedded
JetStream server, so no cluster or credentials are needed. The CI job additionally installs the
envtest binaries and the `nats` CLI; without them the auth callout's API-server and CLI cases skip
and the run still reports green. To match it, run with
`KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS="$(make -C ../k8s-operator -s envtest-path)"` — the path is relative to
`a2a/`, and getting it wrong makes the substitution empty and the cases skip exactly as if it had
not been set.

**Image pins.** `images.json` is the source of truth for every image an install pulls, but a bump
starts there and rarely ends there. Several images keep a second copy that the file is the source
for — a chart value, a Dockerfile `ARG` default, a compiled constant in the operator — and
`make images-check` is what holds them in step. It covers every image the chart renders, on a
default and a mirrored install, and what `githubMinter.enabled=true` adds to each; the build-time
bases against their Dockerfile `ARG` defaults; the Go builder pin against the `go` directive in
`k8s-operator/go.mod`; the fluent-bit fallback baked into the operator binary; the example
manifests; and the kustomize integrations, which it requires to name a variable the file owns
rather than a literal. Two copies it does not reach, where a stale pin passes every check:
Hindsight's images sit behind `hindsight.enabled` — unset by default, and then following
`platformAgent.harness.memory.provider`, which no render turns on — so their pins in
`charts/kube-agents/values.yaml` are unguarded; and cert-manager's version is set again in
`terraform/examples/full-install/variables.tf`, which no check reads. So: bump the pin in
`images.json`, run `make images-check` and `make docs-generate`, then grep the tree for the old
version before opening the pull request.

**Everything at once.** `make verify` runs what a pull request must pass offline — Go build, vet
and test, the Python suites, the conformance suite. The per-area targets it wraps, for a faster
loop while you work:

- `make shellcheck` — the `validate` job in `Validate Repo Structure` runs it after the structure
  check; see **Shell scripts** above for the release to install.
- `make validate` — the structure check in the `Validate Repo Structure` job; fails if skills
  live under `agents/*/defaults/skills/` instead of `agents/*/skills/`.
- `make -C k8s-operator test` — manifests, generate, fmt, vet, the Python suites under
  `k8s-operator/internal/controller` and `agents/platform/scripts`, then the envtest download and
  `go test`; what the `Operator Tests` job runs.
- `make test-integration` — the seam tier only, for a component another one talks to across a
  process or protocol boundary. Install a Go toolchain first: the injector seam compiles the real
  Go event-watcher client, and without `go` on `PATH` its tests skip and the run still prints
  `OK`. [`tests/integration/README.md`](../tests/integration/README.md) is the tier's contract;
  [`testing-map.md`](testing-map.md) says which suite runs where.
- `make docs-check`, plus `cd docs/site && npm ci && npm run build` if you touched `docs/site/`.

## The automated review

`AGENTS.md`, "Automated Review After Opening a Pull Request", says what `kube-agents-bot` is, when
it runs, and what you owe its findings. This section is how you watch for one and answer it.

### How to read it

A 👀 reaction means the review started; a posted review means it finished. Across #630–#699 the 👀
landed within seconds of the trigger, and the review a median of **9 minutes** after that — 15
minutes at the 90th percentile, 45 in the slowest of the 54 reviews in that range (#634, an XXL
diff). A `/review` re-read is no quicker: median 11 minutes, and none of the 42 measured took longer
than 22. A review that runs always reports back, so a one-line "no findings" is a result, not
silence. Findings arrive as inline comments badged 🔴 High, 🟠 Medium, or 🟡 Low; findings the bot
could not anchor to a changed line appear in the summary body under **Findings outside this diff**. A
👀 with nothing following it is a bug in the bot, not a verdict — it happened to 3 of the 57 pull
requests picked up in that range (#647, #649, #679), which is rare enough to be worth waiting through
and common enough that you must not wait forever.

### Waiting for it

Poll on a schedule rather than continuously — nothing is worth checking in the first 5 minutes, then
once a minute. Expect the review by 15 minutes; at 30 with nothing posted, stop waiting and tell the
user the bot dropped this one. Nothing retries on its own, so ask whether to spend a trigger — and
say which: a review that goes missing was a first-review-width one, so `/review all` is what replaces
it, and `/review` narrows the retry to what the bot is certain of (plus any marked high-severity near
miss).

Two things make a wait read wrong:

- **The 👀 does not come back.** A reaction is one per user, so the eyes from the first review are
  still sitting there when you comment `/review` or mark a draft ready. Only the review list moves:
  note how many bot reviews exist _before_ you re-trigger, and wait for that count to change rather
  than for a reaction that already fired.
- **A draft is not waiting on anything.** The trigger is ready-for-review, not opened. Every
  multi-hour gap in the range above was a draft sitting unreviewed by design — #652 for 12 hours,
  #659 for 18 — and measured from the ready event each was picked up in seconds. Do not start the
  clock, or report the bot broken, while the pull request is still a draft.

Poll with:

```bash
# Both commands name gke-labs/kube-agents explicitly: PR branches live on forks,
# but the review lives on the upstream pull request.

# Has the bot reviewed yet? Takes the LAST bot review and prints its timestamp
# first: after a /review the earlier review is still there, and reading it back
# looks exactly like the new one having landed. No output = no review yet.
# (gh reports the login without the [bot] suffix; the REST API below adds it.)
gh pr view <number> --repo gke-labs/kube-agents --json reviews \
  --jq '[.reviews[] | select(.author.login == "kube-agents-bot")] | last | select(.)
        | "\(.submittedAt)\n\(.body)"'

# The inline findings, with the comment ids needed to reply. --paginate matters:
# the default page holds 30 comments and a truncated list still looks complete.
# .line is null once a finding's line falls out of the diff, hence the fallback.
gh api repos/gke-labs/kube-agents/pulls/<number>/comments --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | select(.user.login == "kube-agents-bot[bot]")
        | "\(.path):\(.line // .original_line) [id \(.id)]\n\(.body)\n"'
```

### Replying to a finding

A finding you disagree with gets answered in its thread, not silently dropped:

```bash
gh api repos/gke-labs/kube-agents/pulls/<number>/comments/<comment-id>/replies \
  -f body='<the reasoning>'
```

## Resolving conversations

Reply first — `AGENTS.md` says why — naming what changed and the commit that changed it. Then
resolve. A pull request carrying both `lgtm` and `approved` with a thread still open also carries
the `do-not-merge` label,
applied by a workflow so that Tide does not spend the queue retrying a merge GitHub will refuse;
resolving the last thread is what removes it ([how a change merges](#how-a-change-merges)).

```bash
# Every unresolved thread, with both ids you need: resolveReviewThread takes the
# thread's node id, while the reply endpoint above takes the first comment's
# databaseId. REST returns only the latter, which is why this one is GraphQL.
gh api graphql -f query='
query($pr: Int!) {
  repository(owner: "gke-labs", name: "kube-agents") {
    pullRequest(number: $pr) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          id isResolved isOutdated viewerCanResolve path line
          comments(first: 20) { nodes { databaseId author { login } body } }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' -F pr=<number> --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[]
  | select(.isResolved | not)
  | "\(.path):\(.line // "outdated") thread \(.id) canResolve=\(.viewerCanResolve)
  reply to \(.comments.nodes[0].databaseId) — \(.comments.nodes[0].author.login): \(.comments.nodes[0].body | split("\n")[0])
  replies so far: \(.comments.nodes | length - 1)"'

# Per thread, once the reply naming the fix is posted:
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($thread: ID!) {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: $thread}) { thread { isResolved } }
}' -f thread='<PRRT_...>'
```

Four ways that goes wrong quietly:

- `first: 100` is a cap, not a promise. A long-lived pull request can carry more threads than that;
  page for the rest, or say you only looked at the first hundred rather than reporting the branch
  clear.
- `line` is `null` once a thread's line falls out of the diff. Outdated is not addressed — the code
  moved, which says nothing about whether the finding still holds. Read the thread.
- `viewerCanResolve` is the authoritative answer to whether your token can resolve at all; it
  differs between a maintainer and a contributor pushing from a fork. Check it before you reply,
  because a mutation that fails after the reply is posted leaves a half-answered thread that looks
  handled.
- `unresolveReviewThread`, same `threadId`, is the undo. Use it the moment the user disagrees with
  something you resolved.

## How a change merges

Nobody presses Merge. This is a Prow repository: `google-oss-prow` squash-merges a pull request on
its own once Tide's query matches it, and that query wants the labels `lgtm` and `approved` both
present, with `do-not-merge`, `do-not-merge/hold`, `do-not-merge/invalid-owners-file`, and
`do-not-merge/work-in-progress` all absent. The configuration is
[`prow/oss/config.yaml`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/oss-test-infra/blob/master/prow/oss/config.yaml)
and
[`prow/oss/plugins.yaml`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/oss-test-infra/blob/master/prow/oss/plugins.yaml)
in `GoogleCloudPlatform/oss-test-infra` — another repository, which is why nothing here can be
authoritative about it. Read it there when the answer matters, and
[oss.gprow.dev/command-help](https://oss.gprow.dev/command-help) for the full command set.

The two labels are the two people:

- **`lgtm` is the reviewer's.** A GitHub "Approve" review sets it, and so does `/lgtm` in a comment.
  This is what the auto-requested human reviewer is being asked for. Prow does not take an `/lgtm`
  from the pull request's own author, so every change needs one other person however it is approved.
  `trusted_team_for_sticky_lgtm: Googlers` is configured, which means a push after the label lands
  strips it again unless the author is in that team, and the reviewer has to give it a second time.
- **`approved` is an `OWNERS` approver's.** `/approve`, from someone in the `OWNERS` file governing
  the changed paths — [`OWNERS`](../OWNERS) at the root and [`hack/OWNERS`](../hack/OWNERS) for the
  presubmit eval rosters (`hack/eval/presubmit-cases.txt` and `hack/eval/blocking-roster.txt`)
  alone, with [`OWNERS_ALIASES`](../OWNERS_ALIASES) expanding `eval-crew`. The last names only
  `eval-crew` and sets `no_parent_owners`, so a root approver's `/approve` does not clear a change
  to what the presubmit runs or what blocks; the nightly file and the case directories under
  `bench/tasks/` fall through to the root approvers (#1546). An approver's
  "Approve" review sets both labels at once, which is why most pull requests here need exactly one
  review from one person (#1070). An approver's own pull request counts as self-approved, so a
  change from someone in `OWNERS` starts with the `approved` half already satisfied and waits only
  on the `lgtm` (#1075).

Everyone `.github/auto_request_review.yml` can assign is an `OWNERS` approver for what it assigns
them: its `hack/eval/presubmit-cases.txt` and `hack/eval/blocking-roster.txt` entries send a
change there to its own `eval-crew` group, so the reviewer the bot's green check summons can clear
both labels in one action. Not every `eval-crew` member is a root approver, so a change that also touches root-owned
paths still waits on a root approver's `/approve` after that review. The bot never requests the
author, so a member's own case or roster change goes to the rest of the group, with the author's
`approved` already on it (#1075). That is a property of two lists agreeing today — the alias in
`OWNERS_ALIASES` and the group in the bot's config — not a guarantee either file makes.

Before any of that, a pull request from an author Prow does not already trust is labelled
`needs-ok-to-test`, and its Prow presubmits hold until a member comments `/ok-to-test`. It gates
Prow's jobs, not the GitHub Actions checks, so a pull request can look fully green and still be
waiting on it.

`/hold` parks an otherwise-mergeable pull request without withdrawing anything else, and
`/hold cancel` releases it — #1045 held that way for a smoke test. The bare `do-not-merge` label is
a different thing: [`hold-unresolved-threads.yml`](../.github/workflows/hold-unresolved-threads.yml)
puts it on any pull request in the pool whose review threads are not all resolved, and takes it off
at the next five-minute sweep after the last resolution. Tide does not read the
conversation-resolution rule, so without the label it picks such a pull request, fails the merge,
and retries it every ~85 seconds ahead of everyone else — #608 and #1197 held the queue that way
for an hour on 2026-09-05. `/hold cancel` does not remove this label; resolving the threads does.
A person who applies the same label by hand keeps it: the workflow removes only what it added.
`/override <context>`, which only
a repository admin can use, forces a check that cannot pass on its own, required or not. The forced status
embeds the base SHA at override time, so by itself it would expire on the next merge to `main` and
Tide would re-run the job — which is how an override came to need repeating whenever `main` moved
before Tide merged (#1202). The re-pin below carries it across merges the way it carries a green, so
an override usually holds for the head it was given until a push — subject to the same race with
Tide's sync, and a lost race costs more here, because the retest is of a check that cannot pass: it
comes back red and the override has to be given again. Prow's `/override-sticky` would do this
without the race, with the `[prow:skip-retest]` sentinel Tide accepts regardless of base — but it is
not in the Prow build this repository merges through: the
[plugin help](https://oss.gprow.dev/command-help?repo=gke-labs%2Fkube-agents) lists only
`/override`, and the command is silently ignored.

**Branch protection is not the gate and reads as though there is none.** `main` requires ten
contexts — `cla/google`, `actionlint`, `build`, `prettier`, `validate`, `Run Controller Tests`,
`Run Python Unit Tests`, `Documentation Checks`, `Validate Conventional Commit PR Title`, and
`Agent instructions cite assets that exist` — and conversation resolution, but **zero** approving
reviews, because approval is Tide's business rather than GitHub's. A reader who checks the
repository settings for the review requirement therefore finds nothing and concludes wrongly.

The last four joined the set on 2026-09-02; before that, a pull request they had not run on could
merge without them.

Those ten are not the whole required set either. Tide also requires every Prow presubmit not marked
`optional`, and those are configured in `oss-test-infra` rather than in branch protection —
`pull-kube-agents-smoke-test` dropped its `optional: true` on 2026-09-02
(GoogleCloudPlatform/oss-test-infra#2677), so the behavioural presubmit gates every merge from that
date. The command below therefore answers part of the question, and the two lists together still do
not answer all of it: they say which contexts must be _present_ and green, but Tide also refuses any
posted context that is not green, required or not, unless Prow marks it `optional`: Tide always
reads a cancelled or failed check run as a failing context, and with no Tide context policy for this
repository an unknown context is not optional. A `classify` run cancelled
by a superseding event held #1364 unmerged with `lgtm` and `approved` on it, though `classify` is in
neither list. `tide`'s own status names the offending context; `gh run rerun <run-id> --job <job-id>`
clears it — by job ID, since `--failed` (below) re-runs failed jobs and a cancelled one is not failed.

```bash
gh api repos/gke-labs/kube-agents/branches/main/protection \
  --jq '.required_status_checks.contexts'
```

**A green smoke run stays valid when `main` moves — usually.** Tide credits a Prow presubmit only
against the base SHA it ran on — crier records it as a `BaseSHA:<sha>` suffix on the commit status
— so on its own every merge to `main` would invalidate every other pull request's green
`pull-kube-agents-smoke-test` and re-run the whole job for a pull request whose head has not
changed (#1179, #1202). [`smoke-test-sticky.yml`](../.github/workflows/smoke-test-sticky.yml) re-pins that suffix
to the new head of `main` — for every open pull request against `main` on each push to `main`, and
for one commit when its green arrives after `main` has already moved — with a note in the
description saying so, and Tide reads the result as current. It is a race against Tide's roughly
once-a-minute sync: when the sweep lands first, a pull request green at its own head merges without
a fresh-base retest, one per sync once no batch is in flight; when Tide's sync lands first it
starts the retest as before (a batch, when two or more qualify), crier's `pending` is then the
newer status, and the sweep leaves it alone. A push still starts a fresh run;
`/test pull-kube-agents-smoke-test` on the same head posts `pending`, which wins until that run
reports (`/retest` does not, because it reruns only failed contexts); a red is never touched, and
an admin `/override` is carried the same way as a green, because crier stamps the same `BaseSHA:`
suffix on it. What this trades away is testing the combination with the `main`
it lands on before the merge; until a scheduled eval run on `main` exists, a bad combination is
found by the next smoke run that actually starts after it — a push or `/test` on whichever pull
request that is, whose author then sees a red that is not theirs. Prow's own form of this — a `[prow:skip-retest]` sentinel
written by `/override-sticky` — is upstream but not in the Prow build this repository merges
through; `scripts/pin_smoke_status.py` says when to switch.

**`mergeStateStatus` cannot answer "is this ready to merge" here, and it is the natural thing to
reach for.** Every open pull request reads `BLOCKED` or `DIRTY` and none ever reads `CLEAN`, because
`main` restricts pushes to the `google-oss-prow` app and GitHub scores that restriction as a block
on the querying user. #1065 read `BLOCKED` while carrying both labels and while `tide` reported
`In merge pool.` Ask Tide instead — its status on the head commit states its own reason — and
[oss.gprow.dev/tide](https://oss.gprow.dev/tide) shows the queue. One reason the status omits: a
merge attempt that failed — an unresolved review thread, most often — is retried every ~85
seconds and recorded only in the `err` field of
[tide-history](https://oss.gprow.dev/tide-history); #1122 sat approved for 5h46m and 231
attempts that way — the case the `do-not-merge` label above now keeps out of the pool.

```bash
# Why Tide has not merged it: its own reason first, then the labels it wants.
gh api repos/gke-labs/kube-agents/commits/<head-sha>/status \
  --jq '.statuses[] | select(.context == "tide") | "\(.state): \(.description)"'
gh pr view <number> --repo gke-labs/kube-agents --json labels --jq '[.labels[].name]'
```

## Re-running a check that failed

A GitHub Actions check that fails on a pull request whose diff cannot have caused it is worth one
re-run, from the run's page or with `gh run rerun <run-id> --failed`. That re-run is also a report.
[`flaky-check-notify.yml`](../.github/workflows/flaky-check-notify.yml) watches the completed
attempts of the checks its `workflow_run` trigger lists, and when an attempt after the first passes
on the same commit an earlier attempt failed on, it opens a `ci:flaky` issue per failing test class
(or Go test, or pytest file) the failed attempts' logs name, falling back to one per failing job and
step when they name none or name more than a handful, or adds a row to the issue that class already
has. The tree did not change
between the attempts, so the code was not the cause; the issue is where the occurrences accumulate
until someone
reads them together. It never closes an issue, because every green run of a flaky check looks like a
fix from the outside; close it when the cause is fixed, and a recurrence opens a new one that links
back. `scripts/notify_flaky_check.py` holds the reasoning; the workflow's header says why
`Validate PR Title` and `Security Scanning` are left off.

A re-run that fails again records nothing, and neither does a push that happens to go green: only a
same-commit pass after a failure is evidence the code was innocent. Prow's `/retest` on the smoke
test is a different system and is not watched; the `presubmit-gate` label is that job's channel.

## Who owns an open pull request

Every open pull request has exactly one party whose move it is, and the commonest way one sits for
a fortnight is that both sides believe it is the other's. The rule:

**The author owns it while it is blocked on them** — a draft, a failing or cancelled check that
`tide` names, merge conflicts, unresolved review threads, changes requested, or no human reviewer
requested yet.
**Otherwise the requested reviewers own it.** A past reviewer does not: an approval already given
is not an outstanding obligation. `kube-agents-bot` and other bot reviewers never count either way.

A draft is owned by its author and waited on by nobody, so it is not a backlog item — it is work in
progress, and chasing it is noise.

Four states that look like somebody else's problem and are not:

- **`CHANGES_REQUESTED` does not clear itself.** It stays set until a reviewer submits a _new_
  review. Pushing the fix does not clear it, resolving every thread does not clear it, and GitHub
  will report `CHANGES_REQUESTED` and "review requested from X" in the same breath. Re-requesting
  review is the explicit hand-back — do that rather than assuming the push spoke for itself.
- **Nobody is requested at all.** Because a human is only assigned once the `AI Review` check goes
  green, an author with outstanding bot findings has no reviewer and no notification saying so.
  Clearing the findings and commenting `/review` for a clean pass is what summons one;
  `/request-review` is the override. Answering every bot thread does not summon one by itself, so
  an author who has done everything asked of them can still be sitting with nobody assigned.
- **A red check that is not required.** It still blocks the merge if it is red on the head: Tide
  refuses any posted context that is not green unless Prow marks it `optional`, not only the ones on
  the two lists above, so a cancelled run of a non-required job is the author's problem too. `tide`
  is what actually knows —
  ask it before treating a failing job as work owed, and before concluding one is not.
- **`mergeable: UNKNOWN`.** GitHub computes mergeability lazily and the first query only triggers
  the job, so a conflict reads as conflict-free until you ask twice.

`skip_reason()` and `already_reviewed_reason()` in
[`scripts/request_reviewers.py`](../scripts/request_reviewers.py) are the same rule in code for the
one decision this repository automates — it declines to request a reviewer for a draft, for a title
carrying an ignored keyword, when someone is already requested, when an `OWNERS` approver for one of
the changed files has submitted `APPROVED`, and when a human other than the author has submitted
`CHANGES_REQUESTED` — each person's latest verdict, as GitHub counts them. An approval from outside
`OWNERS` is not a hand-off: it cannot produce the `approved` label, so it counts no more than a
comment. Of these reasons, `/request-review` skips the verdict check alone (it also bypasses the
`AI Review` gate, per `AGENTS.md`) — a person has already read the pull request and asked — and when
one of the other reasons still declines it, the comment gets 😕 and the run a warning annotation
naming the reason. A periodic
triage sweep applies the wider rule and messages whoever owns each pull request; it runs outside
this repository, so the rule above is all this page can state about it.

```bash
# Whose move is it: draft, conflicts, verdict, and who is on the hook now.
gh pr view <number> --repo gke-labs/kube-agents \
  --json isDraft,mergeable,reviewDecision,reviewRequests \
  --jq '{draft: .isDraft, mergeable, decision: .reviewDecision,
         requested: [.reviewRequests[].login]}'
```
