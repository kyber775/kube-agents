// The inject backend: an HTTP door into handleInbound, for a harness that has
// to drive the gateway the way a chat user does. It is the next-stack
// analogue of the eval harness's POST to the agent's own /v1/responses -- the
// same idea as the Discord test backend in spec-chatops-gateway.md, with the
// eval as the consumer rather than a human.
//
// DEV AND EVAL ONLY. Five things confine it, and the first is the only one
// inside this file.
//
// Every request carries a bearer token (A2A_INJECT_TOKEN, which the operator
// renders into a Secret under its eval flag and the gateway refuses to arm
// the door without). The other four are the operator's: the door renders
// only under that flag, it listens on the gateway pod's loopback rather than
// every interface, its Service is a ClusterIP that exists to give `kubectl
// port-forward` a name and routes nothing, and while it is armed a
// NetworkPolicy fences the gateway pod against every pod on the cluster
// network.
//
// The token is not belt-and-braces over the bind and the fence, it is the
// control, and those are the secondary. The eval runner reaches the door
// through `kubectl port-forward`, which the kubelet serves from inside the
// pod's network namespace and is not pod-network traffic -- so neither the
// loopback bind nor the fence governs the door's own caller. Without a
// token, the population that can drive the platform persona with the
// install's cluster and GitHub credentials would be everyone holding
// pods/portforward in the namespace, rather than the holders of the agent's
// API key the door stands in for. (A hostNetwork pod on the gateway's node
// is in the node's network namespace, not the pod's, so the loopback bind
// is not reachable from it either; the token is what any caller that does
// reach the listener still has to hold.)
//
// What the token is not is an identity. It says the caller may use the door;
// the author in the request body says who they claim to be, and the door's
// own principal map (Gateway.resolveInjectPrincipal) is what decides whether
// that claim resolves to anything -- to an eval identity, never a cloud one.
// The design section in spec-chatops-gateway.md states the same in the place
// a reader looks for posture.
