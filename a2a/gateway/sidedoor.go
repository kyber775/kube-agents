// sideDoorDrainBound is how long Run waits for the second half to stop once
// the first has: the door drains in-flight requests for injectShutdownGrace,
// and the chat half's own shutdown needs a moment beyond that. Bounded so a
// half that ignores its context cannot keep a gateway that has decided to
// exit alive.

// The side door beside a real backend: one gateway, two ingresses.
//
// The one-backend guard refuses two real backends because two processes on
// one Chat relay durable split its event deliveries, and the symptom is a
// gateway that answers half the messages. The inject door has no such failure
// mode -- it consumes nothing and competes for nothing -- and stage 2 of the
// eval transport needs the door and the Chat relay on one install so the two
// can be compared against it (the A2A owner's reading, 2026-09-17).
//
// So this composite, rather than a second Deployment: Run delivers from both
// into the same handleInbound, and everything the gateway sends back is
// routed by the conversation's own key. Backend-qualified keys are what make
// that safe -- a synthetic conversation is spelled `inject:...` and a real
// one is not, so no post can reach the wrong ingress.

// sideDoorAdapter pairs a real backend with the inject door. It is an Adapter
// like either half, so the gateway drives it without knowing there are two.
