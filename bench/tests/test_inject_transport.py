"""Functional tests for the inject transport.

A local HTTP stub stands in for the A2A gateway's inject side door, serving
the three endpoints the real one serves (submit, the read route with its
probe, cancel) and scripted with the transcript a given task produced and
what the gateway's record shows. ``AGENT_INJECT_URL`` points the harness at
it, so nothing here spawns ``kubectl``. This exercises the full preflight ->
submit -> poll -> fold -> classify -> AgentResult path the eval harness
consumes.

The stub's replies are shaped from what the gateway actually posts
(``a2a/gateway/relay.go``): a placeholder that gets edited as the rolling
progress line, the deliverable as its own post, and a terminal entry after
both. Its probe is shaped from ``probeReport`` in ``a2a/gateway/inject.go``:
a pure read of the record, which the harness classifies. It also demands the
bearer token on every request, as the door does, and dedupes a POST on its
message id, as the door does.
