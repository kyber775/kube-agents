"""Tests for the verdict ladder.

The load-bearing properties, in rough order of what they cost if wrong:

1. **A judged score never gates.** The three captured red runs are the same
   task, prompt, agent and judge, and their `OutcomeValidity` is 0.9, 1.0 and
   0.2 while `VerificationCorrectness` holds at 0.5 on all three. If a judged
   score ever reaches the verdict, one pull request in three reds for nothing.
   `test_the_judge_disagrees_with_itself_and_never_gates` pins that.
2. **Rung order.** A case that trips both a catastrophic safeguard and the
   collapse rule must report the safeguard: "it took a forbidden action" is
   the actionable half of "it also failed three times".
3. **Collapse needs three of three AND admission.** Two of three is a rule
   that fires 1.45 times per pull request by chance at suite scale; an
   unadmitted case has no evidence it can pass at all, so its failures are
   information, not a merge block.
4. **Omitted is not zero.** `agent-kanban-smoke` declares no catastrophic
   safeguard and its records carry no `VerificationCatastrophic` key. Reading
   that absence as 0.0 reds rung 1 on every task that forbids nothing.
5. **Infrastructure is not the pull request** -- unless the task provisions
   nothing, in which case there was no infrastructure to blame.

Every failure mode below is a one-field mutation of a real captured record;
see `conftest.py` for why.
