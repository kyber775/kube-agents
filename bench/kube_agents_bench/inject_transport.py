"""The inject transport behind ``AGENT_TRANSPORT=inject``.

The harness hands a case's prompt to the agent the way a customer hands it a
chat message under ``spec.mode: next``: one ``POST /inject`` on the A2A
gateway's inject side door, which enters ``handleInbound`` like a message from
any other backend -- routing, the session record, ``startTask``, the bus, and
the relay posting the reply back into the conversation. What the harness
grades is what the conversation received, which is the point: if a customer
would not see it, a verifier should not depend on it.

This module is the door half: the three HTTP calls (submit; the read that
polls the transcript and, with ``probe=1``, the gateway's own record; and the
cancel), the fold of a conversation's transcript, the classification of how a
task ended, and one submit-and-await exchange. Environment, port-forwards,
retry classes and the mapping onto ``AgentResult`` stay in
:mod:`kube_agents_bench.harness`, which is the only importer.

The wait is written as "await the terminal of task id X" rather than "await
the task I submitted" (the A2A owner's instruction on #1661): when
agent-initiated delegation becomes a child task on the bus, the parent's
events will name the child's id and the same call awaits that instead. The
kanban poll that stands in for child tasks today is NOT here -- it lives in
the case runner, so it can be deleted without touching this module.

The gateway's inject door is dev and eval only. Every request carries the
bearer token the operator mints into a Secret beside the door, which the
harness reads the way the presubmit reads the agent's own API key; see
``a2a/gateway/inject.go`` and the test-backend section of
``docs/designs/spec-chatops-gateway.md``.

    ``deliverable`` is the answer: every post this task produced that nothing
    rewrote, in order. Two rules make that the right set.

    The rolling status line is a post the relay rewrites as progress arrives
    (``⏳ submitted…`` becoming ``⚙️ working`` and so on), so an edited post is
    presentation and is excluded. Discriminating on "was this ever edited"
    rather than on the wording of the placeholder keeps the harness out of the
    business of recognising the relay's prose, which is free to change.

    And the answer can be more than one post. ``Gateway.post`` splits anything
    over its backend chunk cap into separate posts, so an agent report of any
    length arrives as several -- taking only the last would grade a long RCA
    on its closing fragment, which is how a report naming the right cause in
    its first paragraph fails a phrase check. They are joined with no
    separator, because that is what reassembles a chunked message exactly: the
    gateway cuts on a line break where it can and mid-text where it cannot, so

    is looking for.

        took, the gateway's own never-started heal releases the record on

        a bridge that binds later within retention would otherwise run the

        that spawn -- the consumer delivers serially, so an idle worker
        spawns the stale prompt before the cancel is dispatched, and the
        cancel then kills it inside the bridge's kill grace with a
        ``canceled-by-request`` terminal; ``canceled-before-start`` is what a

        confirms inside ``settle``, is ``canceled`` with the executor's
        reason.
