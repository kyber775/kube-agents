"""The rate-based verdict ladder: per-rep classification, collapse, aggregate.

WHY A RATE AND NOT A PASS. At two hundred cases and 95% per-case reliability,
"every case must pass on every run" is clean on 0.003% of runs. A gate that
reds seven pull requests in eight is a gate people learn to ignore, so the
merge decision is built out of rates and repetitions instead: a case has to
fail ALL its repetitions, and to have already proved it can pass reliably,
before it reds the job on its own.

WHAT STILL BLOCKS ABSOLUTELY. Three things, on any single repetition, because
none of them is a flake: a tripped catastrophic safeguard (rung 1), a declared
check that errored rather than ran (rung 2), and a record that is not evidence
of a real agent run (rung 3). Rungs 1-3 are the reason the rate rules are safe
— without them "most runs passed" could be assembled out of runs that never
happened. One carve-out (#1184): a record showing no run AT ALL — empty
trajectory, tokens.total exactly 0 — is classified infrastructure and
excluded from the rate rather than graded, so it can never be assembled into
a pass either; rung 3 keeps blocking the inconsistent shapes.

HOW THE JUDGE IS AND IS NOT USED. No judged score is ever compared against an
absolute threshold, and the reason is measured rather than assumed: three
identical runs of ``agent-kanban-smoke`` scored 0.9, 1.0 and 0.2 while
``VerificationCorrectness`` held at 0.5 on all three. A fixed cut would have
redded one of those three for nothing. What rung 6 does instead is compare a
judged mean against the SAME metric's mean on ``main``, for an admitted case
only, with a margin wide enough to absorb that spread -- see
:data:`DEFAULT_JUDGED_MARGIN`, which is derived from it.

#: The literal a caller passes for a repetition that produced no run directory
#: at all -- devops-bench died before writing one. Distinct from a directory
#: that exists but holds an unusable record, which is a different diagnosis.
MISSING = "MISSING"

#: ``VerificationCorrectness`` at or above this is a passing repetition. The
#: existing presubmit floor, unchanged; the CLI reads it from the environment.
DEFAULT_CORRECTNESS_FLOOR = 1.0

#: Scored repetitions the aggregate needs before it may BLOCK. Below this it
#: is still computed and still reported -- it just cannot red the job.
#:
#: The aggregate is a suite-scale non-inferiority rule and a flat margin is
#: only meaningful at suite scale. The arithmetic, at the 0.05 default margin
#: against a baseline screened at the 19/20 admission bar (0.95, so the
#: blocking threshold is 0.90): a run of ``n`` scored repetitions survives
#: ``floor(n * 0.098)`` failures. One flaky repetition therefore reds the job
#: outright at any ``n`` below 11 -- and with a single admitted case at three
#: repetitions, ``n`` IS 3 and 2/3 = 0.667 is nowhere near 0.902.
#:
#: That is precisely ``agent-kanban-smoke``'s failure mode -- one bad run reds
#: an unchanged pull request -- reintroduced through the aggregate on the day
#: the first case is screened in, and it would contradict the promise the
#: per-case ladder makes two rungs above it. The floor closes it by refusing
#: to compare rather than by widening the margin, because no single flat
#: margin is right at both n=3 and n=600.
#:
#: 30 is ten admitted cases at three repetitions, and it tolerates two failed
#: repetitions. The properly-sized fix is a two-proportion test with a real
#: variance estimate, which needs the nightly to have run against ``main``
#: enough times to have one; this floor is what holds until then, and the
#: normal approximation is not a substitute -- at n=3 two standard errors is
#: 0.247, which still reds 2/3.
DEFAULT_AGGREGATE_MIN_SCORED = 30

#: Terminal record status devops-bench writes for a run that completed. The
#: only other value is ``"failed"`` (``devops_bench/results/row.py``), which
#: means the run itself died -- NOT that the agent got the task wrong. Our
#: three red fixtures all carry ``"success"``.
_STATUS_SUCCESS = "success"

#: Judged metrics rung 6 compares against main. ``OutcomeValidity`` alone by
#: default -- it is the one the presubmit already used as its judged fallback,
#: and every extra metric is another independent chance to red a pull request
#: on judge noise. ``ToolInvocation`` and ``OutcomeScore`` are still recorded
#: and still land in the baseline; they are reported, not gated.
DEFAULT_JUDGED_METRICS: tuple[str, ...] = ("OutcomeValidity",)

#: How far a judged mean may fall below main's before rung 6 fires.
#:
#: 0.5 is not a preference, it is arithmetic on the captured spread. Three
#: repetitions of ONE UNCHANGED task scored 0.9, 1.0 and 0.2 -- a standard
#: deviation near 0.44, so the standard error of a three-repetition mean is
#: about 0.25. A one-standard-error margin would therefore red roughly one
#: unchanged pull request in six; two standard errors reds about one in fifty,
#: which is the same order as the collapse rule was sized to.
#:
#: Say plainly what that buys and what it does not. At this width rung 6
#: catches a COLLAPSE in judged quality and cannot see drift, because at three
#: repetitions drift and noise are the same picture. The way to detect drift is
#: more repetitions or a less variable judged metric -- not a smaller number
#: here, which only converts judge noise into red pull requests and teaches
#: people to ignore the rung.
DEFAULT_JUDGED_MARGIN = 0.5

#: The marker :mod:`kube_agents_bench.harness` writes onto ``errors[0]`` when
#: the agent endpoint failed in transport on every attempt, so no turn ever
#: reached the agent. Such a record IS scored -- the judge grades the empty
#: output and returns 0.0 -- which is exactly the trap: without this check the
#: ladder would read a genuine 0.0 and count the repetition as a real failure,
#: redding the case for a pod restart. There is no answer in the record to
#: grade, so the repetition is infrastructure, not evidence.
#:
#: The literal is duplicated rather than imported because importing the harness
#: would drag ``devops_bench`` into the scorer, which otherwise reads records as
#: plain JSON. ``test_scoring.py`` asserts the two strings agree, so the
#: duplication cannot drift silently.
INFRA_FAILURE_MARKER = "KUBE_AGENTS_INFRA_FAILURE"

#: The trajectory entry name the harness's inject transport gives a task's
#: lifecycle events (``inject_transport.EVENT_ENTRY_STATUS``; a transport
#: that read the bus directly would use the same name). The gateway reports
#: no token usage, so such a record's ``tokens`` are all null and its
#: liveness signal is the executor's own events instead: an entry of this
#: name whose ``args.final`` is true (the task ended), or whose ``args.state``
#: is ``working`` (the executor spawned the persona; a task the harness
#: cancelled at its budget has no final entry and is still a run). A
#: ``submitted`` entry alone is not evidence: the bridge publishes it when it
#: queues a task, before anything runs. Both literals are duplicated rather
#: than imported, for the same reason as the marker above -- importing the
#: transport would drag the harness's dependencies into the scorer -- and
#: ``test_scoring.py`` asserts each agrees with the transport's.
A2A_STATUS_EVENT = "a2a.status-update"
A2A_STATE_WORKING = "working"

#: The marker the harness leads its deadline error with when the delegation
#: wait (``AGENT_DELEGATION_TIMEOUT``) ran out and no awaited card had
#: delivered anything. The record is scored -- the judge grades the front
#: door's acknowledgement and returns a low score -- but the acknowledgement
#: is the designed first reply of an asynchronous delegation, not the answer,
#: and the worker was still running when the harness stopped watching. Such a
#: repetition is the eval's ceiling, not the agent's failure, so it is
#: classified apart: ``infra``, under a reason that leads with this marker so
#: the dashboard can tell it from a quota storm (which also reads ``infra``)
#: and keep it out of the storm signature. A ceiling hit with a partial
#: delivery carries no marker and grades on what arrived. Duplicated rather
#: than imported for the same reason as the marker above; ``test_scoring.py``
#: asserts the two strings agree.
DELEGATION_CEILING_MARKER = "KUBE_AGENTS_DELEGATION_CEILING"

#: Field values from devops-bench's ``_build_failed_record``: ``status`` is
#: ``"failed"`` on every failed record, and ``verification_status`` is
#: ``"not_evaluated"`` when verification did not run -- which has TWO
#: producers, not one. The exception path writes it when the deployer never
#: came up, and also when infrastructure WAS up but its own verification
#: retry crashed while building the failed record. That second producer, and
#: the fact that a failed record always carries an empty trajectory (the
#: builder overlays ``_empty_record`` and never copies the agent's trajectory,
#: even when an agent ran), are why these values narrow the provisioning-death
#: shape but cannot identify it: ``classify_rep`` also requires the error
#: signature below. Duplicated rather than imported for the same reason as
#: the marker above: the scorer reads records as plain JSON and must not
#: import ``devops_bench``.
FAILED_RECORD_STATUS = "failed"
VERIFICATION_NEVER_RAN = "not_evaluated"

#: How devops-bench's ``SubprocessError`` renders a command that exited
#: non-zero (``devops_bench/core/errors.py``): this prefix, one ``": "``, then
#: the command line itself, with any stderr on later lines. ``classify_rep``
#: accepts a scoreless failed record as a provisioning death only when the
#: command after the prefix is the task's own deployer -- the registry key and
#: the binary agree for every deployer devops-bench ships (``"tofu"`` shells
#: ``tofu``), and nothing downstream of ``deployer.up()`` shells that binary,
#: so an agent-step or verifier crash cannot produce the signature. A crash
#: whose error does not match stays a blocking rung-2 record, which is the
#: fail-closed side of the trade.
PROVISION_FAILURE_PREFIX = "command failed with exit code "

#: The three values of :attr:`SuiteVerdict.outcome`. ``green`` and ``red``
#: are the two the job has always had. ``not_evaluated`` is the third: the
#: run cannot certify green because an admitted case lost every repetition
#: to infrastructure (or every case did), and it is not red either, because
#: nothing in it is a finding against the change under test. It exists so a

    ``cases`` are :meth:`CaseVerdict.to_dict` payloads, read back from the
    per-case JSON the shell wrote. The aggregate covers ADMITTED cases only
    and excludes infrastructure repetitions: an unscreened case's pass rate is
    not yet a number anything should be compared against.

    It also covers a large enough sample to mean something. Below
    ``min_scored`` scored repetitions the rate is computed and reported but
    cannot block -- see :data:`DEFAULT_AGGREGATE_MIN_SCORED` for why a flat
    margin at n=3 is a coin flip rather than a gate.

    And it blocks only when ``armed``. Unarmed -- the default, and what the
    CLI passes until ``EVAL_AGGREGATE_ARMED`` says otherwise -- a rate below
    the margin over a full sample is still computed and still reported, as a
    note the markdown renders, rather than as a reason that reds the job.
    The flat margin has never been measured against how much an unchanged
    pull request's aggregate moves on main; arming it is a decision to take
    once the store holds enough nights to say.

    Green also needs a floor under its coverage. Every fix that routes an
    environment-health shape into an infrastructure classification is right
    on its own -- the repetition is not evidence about the change -- but
    each one makes green easier to earn on a sick environment, because the
    aggregate has fewer repetitions to compare and the per-case rungs have
    fewer to grade. The floor is per admitted case: an admitted case with no
    scored repetition at all was not evaluated, and a run that did not
    evaluate a case on the blocking roster cannot certify green whatever the
    survivors scored. That run's outcome is ``not_evaluated``, not ``red``:
    weather took the case, the change under test is not what to debug, and
    the answer is a rerun when the environment is healthy. The all-cases
    guard below is the same rule at the limit and reports the same outcome.

    Precedence: a blocking case or an armed aggregate below the margin is a
    finding against the change, and it outranks the weather -- the outcome is
    ``red`` with the wiped cases listed among the reasons and ``not_evaluated``
    left empty. Otherwise a wiped admitted case, or every case lost, is
    ``not_evaluated``. No case results at all stays ``red``: the loop wrote
    nothing, which is the job's failure and not the environment's.
