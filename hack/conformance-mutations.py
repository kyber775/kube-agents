"""Mutation-verify the conformance suite: delete a control, expect red.

If deleting a control leaves the suite green, the test does not exist. Slice 2a
shipped a whole gate that could be removed with its suite byte-identical, and
only a dedicated task caught it -- so this is the property the conformance
suite is graded on, not test count.

Each mutation names the control it removes and the test it must break. The run
applies one mutation at a time to the working tree, runs the suite, restores
the file with `git checkout`, and reports:

    KILLED   the named test failed. The test is real.
    SURVIVED the named test still passed. The test is theatre -- fix it.
    NOISY    the mutation broke something other than the named test as well.
             Not a failure, but worth reading: it usually means two assertions
             overlap, and occasionally means the mutation was blunter than
             intended.

An expected failure that a mutation turns into an *unexpected success* also
counts as KILLED: the recorded gap moved, which is exactly the signal wanted.

Usage:
    python3 hack/conformance-mutations.py            # every mutation
    python3 hack/conformance-mutations.py --list
    python3 hack/conformance-mutations.py -k C1      # substring filter on the id

The tree must be clean. It edits tracked files in place and restores them, so a
dirty tree risks losing work -- it refuses rather than guessing.
